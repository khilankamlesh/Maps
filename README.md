# The Colossal Adventure Game
## Prerequisites ##
This project was created in Java in Project SDK version 11.0.2 using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.2.2.

This was the third of three projects as part of the Object Oriented Programming module at the University of Birmingham, implementing HashMaps and Hashsets as well as advanced OOP concepts such as interfaces.

## Goal ##
The goal of this project is to create a text-driven game based on the one created in the 1970's and implement a version of this game.

The program should:
* Determine where the player is.
* Determine possible exits from the current position
* Allow the player to move to another valid direction

## Project Layout ##
* Extract 'JavaAssign3_Khilan_Kamlesh_2307483.zip' and open folder as project in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.
* Code design and implementation in 'Assignment213/src/StudentMarking.java'
* 'Assignment213/locations.txt' contains all possible locations and descriptions to be read by the program.
* 'Assignment213/directions.txt' contains all possible destinations for each location to be read by the program.
* 'Assignment213/testFiles' folder includes .txt files to test the functionality and edge case scenarios in IntelliJ after completing a section of code.
* The results of tests are compared against 'expectedOutput' files in the 'Assignment213/answerFiles' folder using IntelliJ's Run/Debug configurations.
* Output of console is copied to file 'Assignment213/StudentConsoleOutput.txt'
* Output to display to user is copied to file 'Assignment213/StudentFileOutput.txt'
