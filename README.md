# The Colossal Adventure Game
## Prerequisites ##
This project was created in Java in Project SDK version 11.0.2 using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.2.2.

This was the third of three projects as part of the Object Oriented Programming module at the University of Birmingham, implementing HashMaps and Hashsets as well as advanced OOP concepts such as interfaces.

## Goal ##
The goal of this project is to create a text-driven game based on the one created in the 1970's and implement a version of this game.

The program should:
* Determine where the player is.
* Determine possible exits from the current position
* Allow the player to move to another valid direction
